Setting up Security
Step 1) Create a child package called security
Step 2) Create a class (ApplicationSecurityConfig) which extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
Step 3) Create a overriding method called configure
        * Basically here we define what endpoints we need to secure and what not
Step 4) Creating user and overriding default specs
        * Override a interface called UserDetailsService
            i) use builder to specify User Details
        * Set up password configaration to let our application know what encoding to use
            i) Create a @Configration class (PasswordConfig) which creates a @Bean PasswordEncoder
            ii) In our class we are going to autowire this bean as constructor to the class

Step 5) Setting Authorisation
        * Create an enum defining permission
        * Create another enum for defining role
            i) This enum will be used to define the role

******** Using Annotation :
hasRole('ROLE_') hasAnyRole('ROLE_') hasAuthority('permission')hasAnyAuthority('permission')
